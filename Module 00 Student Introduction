# Module 00 – Student Introduction (CEH)

## 🧭 What is the CEH Program?

The **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)** program trains individuals to:
- Understand how hackers think and operate
- Identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in systems
- Use attacker-like methods **legally and ethically**
- Strengthen the security posture of organizations

The idea is simple:  
To stop a hacker, you must first understand how a hacker thinks.

## 🎯 Purpose of Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking exists because:
- Systems worldwide are constantly attacked
- Skilled attackers compromise machines, steal data, and erase traces
- Organizations need **preemptive protection**

The goal of an ethical hacker is to:
- Test and attack the system **with authorization**
- Identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve security

## 🧩 Why “Thinking Like a Hacker” Matters

Hacking requires:
- Creativity  
- Unconventional thinking  
- Understanding real-world attacker techniques  

Because of this:
- Standard vulnerability testing
- Basic security audits

…are **not enough** to fully secure an organization.

### ✔ Defense-in-Depth Approach  
Organizations must:
- Conduct layered security assessments  
- Penetrate their own networks  
- Identify exposure and risk  
- Continuously test their security posture  

This multi-layered model provides **true resilience**.

## 👤 Who Is an Ethical Hacker?

An ethical hacker is:
- Trusted by the organization  
- Authorized to conduct penetration testing  
- Skilled in the same tools and techniques used by attackers  
- Expected to operate with professionalism and confidentiality  

**Key Requirement:**  
Ethical hacking is only legal when performed *with written permission*.

## ⚖️ Legal Aspect of Ethical Hacking

- Hacking is illegal and punishable in many countries  
- Ethical hacking becomes legal only with:  
  - Authorization  
  - Contracts  
  - Defined scope  
  - Compliance with laws (e.g., IT Act 2000 in India)

**Without permission → it is a crime.**

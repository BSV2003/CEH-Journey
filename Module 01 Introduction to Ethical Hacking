## 🧨 Why Study Ethical Hacking?

Attackers break into systems for many reasons—financial gain, espionage, disruption, thrill, revenge, etc.  
To defend systems effectively, security professionals must understand:
- How attackers think  
- How they exploit systems  
- Why they attack  

As Sun Tzu said in *The Art of War*:  
**“Know your enemy.”**

# 🔐 Information Security Concepts

Information security refers to the protection of information and information systems that **store, process, and transmit data**, preventing:
- Unauthorized access  
- Disclosure  
- Alteration  
- Destruction  

Information is a critical asset. If compromised, an organization may face:
- Financial loss  
- Reputation damage  
- Customer loss  
- Legal consequences  

This section introduces the **5 elements of information security**.

## 🛡️ Elements of Information Security (CIAAN)

Information security is based on five foundational principles:

---

### 1️⃣ Confidentiality  
Ensures information is accessible **only to authorized individuals**.

**Controls include:**  
- Data classification  
- Data encryption  
- Secure disposal of devices  

Improper handling or hacking attempts may lead to confidentiality breaches.

---

### 2️⃣ Integrity  
Ensures data is **accurate, trustworthy, and unaltered**.

Integrity protects against:
- Unauthorized changes  
- Data corruption  
- Manipulation  

**Controls include:**  
- Checksums (to detect changes)  
- Access control (restrict who can update/delete data)

---

### 3️⃣ Availability  
Ensures systems are **accessible when needed** by authorized users.

**Measures include:**  
- Disk arrays (for Redundant systems and clustered machines)
- Antivirus protection (to combat malware)
- DDoS prevention systems  

---

### 4️⃣ Authenticity  
Ensures data, users, and communications are **genuine**.

**Controls include:**  
- Biometrics  
- Smart cards  
- Digital certificates  

Authenticity verifies that:
- A user is genuine  
- A transaction is legitimate  
- Data has not been tampered with  

---

### 5️⃣ Non-Repudiation  
Ensures that:
- The sender **cannot deny** sending a message  
- The receiver **cannot deny** receiving it  

**Digital signatures** are commonly used to provide non-repudiation.
